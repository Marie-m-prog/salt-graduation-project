        description: `Recycling more at home does not require much effort if you 
        spend some time to create a comprehensive recycling system. This system 
        starts with having places to store your recycled materials in the house, 
        whether this is a box, bin or bag. Keep the recycling container next to the
        trash can and will remind everyone to recycle as much as possible.
        Here are some simple tips to recycle more effectively at home:`,
        list: [
            `Flatten cardboard boxes so that you can fit more recyclables into your bin.`,
            `All plastic bottles can be recycled, from water bottles to salad dressing, so put all of them in your recycling container.`,
            `It is not just newspapers that you can recycle at home. Also, recycle wrapping paper, envelopes, birthday cards and phone books. All sorts of cardboard can be recycled, too, even toilet and paper towel tubes.`,
            `Most metallic items in the home can be recycled, such as empty spray cans and tin foil, and of course, all empty soda, fruit, vegetable and other food cans.`,
            `Keep a space in your cupboard so that you can recycle as you are cooking or cleaning. It will make it easier for you to put the recyclables in their proper place.`,
            `When going out, stop at your local recycling center and drop off anything that was not picked up by your curbside service. This lets you fit your recycling into your life, and will also teach your children about the importance of recycling.`,
            `If you are ever unsure about what you can recycle, check with your refuse provider website. There should be comprehensive information about what is or is not suitable for your recycling container or containers. Most refuse providers also have apps for your smart phone where you can check what to and what not to recycle.`,
            `Glass can be recycled endlessly; it does not wear out after several recyclings, so be sure to always recycle your glass bottles and containers.`,
            `To help your recycling center and to keep down foul odors, make sure you wash food waste off of any plastic or glass food containers before putting them in the recycle bin.`,

        description: `The last major place you can make a difference in recycling is at work. Below are some ways that you can easily increase your recycling and reusing in the office:`,
        list: [
            `Pack lunch: By bringing your own lunch and snacks to the office in a reusable container (in a reusable bag rather than plastic one), you will reduce packaging waste and also spend less on going out to eat. The average worker in the US spends $37 per week on buying lunch. This can add up to $2000 per year or more.`,
            `Bring your own coffee to work rather than buying coffee at work in throw away cups. Save the environment and your wallet.`,
            `Make office supplies last longer. You can try to use pens, highlighters and markers more sparingly, and also keep them front and center so they are not forgotten in your desk drawers. And keep your markers, pens and glue sticks in a clean dry space as heat and exposure to sun make them dry out.`,
            `Try to precycle your office supplies. This means thinking about recycling before you use anything. For example, you can use old newspaper to wrap things for the mail instead of bubble wrap. Use a reusable tape dispenser at your desk, and use paper clips instead of staples.`,
            `Make your commute green. The average work commute produces 7,000 of carbon emissions per year. You can reduce this by carpooling, biking or walking. If you drive just 10% less per year, this can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by â…“ for many people.`,
            `Reduce your paper consumption. Each office worker in America uses 10,000 sheets of copy paper annually. This is 4 million tons of paper per year! Only print documents when absolutely necessary. Use email for most memos and office communications. Use both sides of copy paper when you can.`,
